\begin{abstract}  % 350 words
  Statistical studies of the exoplanet population have provided key
  insights into their formation histories and evolution. Developing
  an understanding of the planet formation process requires both
  accurate and precise measurements of fundamental planetary parameters
  such as their masses, radii, and orbital characteristics. Planetary
  systems orbiting low mass stars represent superlative opportunities
  to characterize exoplanets in detail as they are plentiful
  within the solar neighbourhood and they are known to commonly host
  multi-planet systems of terrestrial to Neptune-sized planets that are more
  easily detectable than similar planets around Sun-like stars. One major
  deterrent to the characterization of such planets
  is stellar activity and its manifestation in radial velocity (RV)
  measurements that can mask and even mimic planetary signals. \\

  In this thesis, I develop and implement a formalism aimed at enabling the
  detection and precise and accurate characterization of planetary
  systems around low mass stars. This formalism is based around
  semi-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression models that are used to
  simultaneously model planets, in both RV and transit light curve
  observations, and the temporal covariance structure arising from
  stellar activity produced by magnetically active regions on the stellar surface.
  The GP formalism is applied to synthetic RV datasets emulating the
  upcoming planet detection survey using the near-infrared spectropolarimeter
  SPIRou and to synthetic optical and near-infrared measurements of the expected
  population of transiting planets discovered with TESS. I also
  apply the GP formalism to activity modelling in the K2-18 planetary system
  from which an accurate and precise planetary mass of its transiting temperate
  sub-Neptune is inferred along with the presence of an additional planet in the
  system using RV measurements from HARPS and CARMENES. Lastly,
  I extend the GP formalism to the treatment of stellar photometric variability
  and systematic effects in TESS light curves and uncover a number of candidate
  transiting planets around low mass stars in the first two TESS sectors. \\

  Applications of GPs
  for the detection and characterization of exoplanets will prove to be a
  crucial tool for developing a global understanding of planet formation and
  in revealing how common the conditions for life like our own are within our
  galaxy.
