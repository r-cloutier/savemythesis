\section{RVFC}
M dwarf model spectra are known to be inaccurate \citep{passegger16}

\begin{itemize}
\item update the M dwarf stellar spectra in the \texttt{RVFC}
\item add a more realistic treatment of telluric contamination when computing
  \sigRV{} to avoid eliminating such large regions of the near-IR wavelength
  domain
\end{itemize}
