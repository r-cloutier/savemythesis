\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

This thesis has focused on the development and implementation of
semi-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression modelling of stellar activity
and other nuissance signals. The GP formalism helps enable the detection as
well as the precise and accurate characterization of exoplanetary systems
around low mass stars in particular. \\

In Chapter~\ref{chap:BS} I simulated the
now ongoing SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search (SLS-PS)
in which I search for planets
in synthetic RV time series using a GP treatment of activity to detect
those planets and calculate the expected planet yield of the survey. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:rvfc} I derive an analytical framework to calculate the
RV observational requirement to measure the masses of transiting planets at
a desired level of precision in the presence of correlated RV residuals stemming
from stellar activity and treated as a quasi-periodic GP as has largely become
conventional within the field. In Chapter\ref{chap:k218} the GP formalism is
applied to empirical time series from K2, HARPS, and CARMENES of the transiting
planetary system around the nearby mid-M dwarf K2-18. Lastly,
Chapter\ref{chap:orion} extends the one-dimensional GP regression modelling to
the search for transiting planets in high cadence light curves from TESS. Here
GP modelling was used to treat stellar varaibaility and residual systematic
effects while searching for repeating transit-like events in the 2 minute
extracted light curves. \\

Each of the applications of the GP formalism in the aforementioned chapters
may lead to a number of improvements or continued paths of investigation which
are discussed below.

\section{On the Accuracy of the SLS-PS Planet Yield Predictions}
Although not a critical assessment, in four years time it would be interesting
to compare the actual yield of the SLS-PS to the predictions presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:BS}. The details of making this comparison one-to-one will
need to be worked out as the actual time series obtained during the SLS-PS will
certainly differ from those simulated both in terms of size, sampling, and
measurement uncertainties. This may or may not prove to be a major hinderance
however because it was determined through comparsion of many flavours of the
simulated SLS-PS that for \nrv{} $\gtrsim 50$, that the GP treatment of stellar
activity results in nearly white RV residuals such that the detection
sensitivity within the survey scales approximately as $\sqrt{N_{\text{RV}}}$ and
as $\sigma_{\text{RV}}^{-1}$. \\

Discrepancies between the predicted and actual planet yields could stem
from any of a number of inconsistencies. The assumed planet occurrence rates
throughout were derived from Kepler statistics and converted to planetary masses
using an empirical mass-radius relation. Inaccuracies from either calculation
in general or their inapplicability to the stars in the SLS-PS target list may
lead to a misestimated planet yield prediction. For example, the input Kepler
statistics were derived from late K to early M dwarfs \citep{dressing15a} and
may not be applicable to the full range of M dwarf spectral types targeted in
the SLS-PS. Another danger with simulated time series is that injected signals
may be too simplistic or that the number of injected signals is incomplete. For
example, the inclusion of systematic RV noise sources may directly affect the
survey's detection sensitivity. Another major source of potential inconsistency
is that the nature of detecting planets in the SLS-PS was based on an automated
detection algorithm intended to emulate the steps taken by a human when
searching for RV planets. Indeed the data flow from RV surveys is sufficently
small that manual planet detection is managable (unlike in large transit
surveys) and variance between human performance and the automated detection
algorithm from \cite{cloutier18a} may result in a different planet yield than
was initially predicted. Overall, it would be an interesting exercise to
isolate which of these sources contributes to the observed differences between
the predicted planet yield and the true planet yield following the conclusion
of the SLS-PS.

\section{Foreseen Improvements to the \texttt{RVFC}}
Recall that the Radial Velocity Follow-up Calculator (\texttt{RVFC}) is a tool
used to calculate the number of RV measurements required to measure a transiting
planet's RV semi-amplitude at a desired level of precision given the properties
of the planet, host star, and RV spectrograph. The properties of the latter two
are required, in part, to compute the photon noise limited RV precision using
model spectra from which the RV information content can be quantified. However,
late K to M dwarf model spectra are known to be incomplete largely due to the
abundance of molecular transitions that are not well understood
\citep{passegger16,behmard19}. Updating the M dwarf model spectra within the
\texttt{RVFC}, from which $\sigms_{\gamma}$ values are calculated, would improve
the accuracy of the \texttt{RVFC} calculations for cool stars. \\

Another limiting factor to the accuracy of computed values of $\sigma_{\gamma}$
is the treatment of telluric contamination. Currently in the \texttt{RVFC},
regions of the spectral domain for which the vertically integrated atmospheric
transmission is below some user-defined threshold are omitted from the
calculation. As noted in Sect.~\ref{sect:tellurics}, these regions are often
wide in the infrared such that calculations of $\sigma_{\gamma}$ in near-IR
bands are likely underestimated relative to the values that could be obtained
if a more sophisticated treatment of telluric contaimination was applied
\citep[e.g.][]{artigau14,bedell19}. Implementation of an accurate model of the
telluric spectrum and its subsequent subtraction from the observed spectrum
would signficantly increase the usable amount of spectral information for stars
observed with near-IR spectrographs and would thus decrease values of
$\sigma_{\gamma}$ in the near-IR closer to typical values in the optical (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:RVFCfig:sigRV}). \\

Another point of potential improvement to the accuracy of the \texttt{RVFC} is
to allow for custom window functions to be used. In the special case of planets
plus white noise in RV time series, exact window function does not affect the
$K$ measurement precision \sigK{} as long as the time series approximately
samples the planet's orbital phase uniformly. However when correlated noise
persists, the form of the window function matters because of the factors
$t_i-t_j$ in the quasi-periodic covariance function. Currently the \texttt{RVFC}
adopts a uniformly spaced window function for correlated noise calculations but
the option for users to define their own window functions that take into account
target visibility and/or observatory resistrictions would be desirable.


\section{Improving our Physical Understanding of M dwarf Stellar Activity}

simultaneous photometry and RVs

The Sun is unique in that its surface can be resolved and observational
signatures seen in various stellar activity diagnostics (e.g. magnetograms,
polarimetry) can be related to exactly what is seen on the Sun's surface.  


\section{Detailing the Accuracy of RV Planet Models in the Presence of a GP}
The GP treatment of stellar activity is known to at times absorb some of
the planetary signal \citep[e.g.][]{ribas18}


In the sense that all models are incomplete, a better understanding of the
physical sources of stellar activity on M dwarfs will help inform any absent
components in our RV models.
