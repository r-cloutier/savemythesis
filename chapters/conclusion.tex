\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

This thesis has focused on the development and implementation of
semi-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression modelling of stellar activity
and other nuisance signals, with a focus on exoplanetary systems around low mass
stars in particular. The GP formalism helps enable the detection as
well as the precise and accurate characterization of planetary parameters
from radial velocity and transit observations. \\

In chapter~\ref{chap:BS} I simulated the
now ongoing SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search (SLS-PS)
in which I search for planets
in synthetic RV time series using a GP treatment of activity to detect
those planets and calculate the expected planet yield of the survey. In
chapter~\ref{chap:rvfc} I derive an analytical framework to calculate the
RV observational requirement to measure the masses of transiting planets at
a desired level of precision in the presence of correlated RV residuals stemming
from stellar activity and treated as a quasi-periodic GP.
In chapters\ref{chap:k2181} and~\ref{chap:k2181} the GP formalism is
applied to empirical time series from K2, HARPS, and CARMENES of the transiting
planetary system around the nearby mid-M dwarf K2-18. Lastly,
chapter\ref{chap:orion} extends the one-dimensional GP regression modelling to
the search for transiting planets in high cadence light curves from TESS. Here,
GP modelling was used to treat stellar variability and residual systematic
artifacts while searching for repeating transit-like events in the TESS 2 minute
extracted light curves of low mass stars. \\

Each of the applications of the GP formalism in the aforementioned chapters
has led to a number of potential improvements or continued paths of investigation
that are discussed in the following sections.

\section{On the Accuracy of the SLS-PS Planet Yield Predictions}
Although not a critical assessment, in four years time it would be interesting
to compare the actual yield of the SLS-PS to the predictions presented in
chapter~\ref{chap:BS}. The details of making this comparison one-to-one will
need to be worked out as the actual time series obtained during the SLS-PS will
certainly differ from those simulated in terms of their sizes, sampling, and
measurement uncertainties. This may or may not prove to be a major hindrance
however because it was determined through comparison of many flavours of the
simulated SLS-PS that for \nrv{} $\gtrsim 50$, that the GP treatment of stellar
activity results in nearly white RV residuals such that the detection
sensitivity within the survey scales approximately as $\sqrt{N_{\text{RV}}}$ and
as $\sigma_{\text{RV}}^{-1}$. \\

Discrepancies between the predicted and actual planet yields could stem
from any of a number of inconsistencies. The assumed planet occurrence rates used
throughout were derived from Kepler statistics (i.e. as a function of planet 
radius) and converted to planetary masses
using an empirical mass-radius relation. Inaccuracies from either calculation
in general or their applicability to the stars in the SLS-PS target list may
lead to a misestimated planet yield prediction. For example, the input Kepler
statistics were derived from late K to early M dwarfs \citep{dressing15a} and
may not be applicable to the full range of M dwarf spectral types targeted in
the SLS-PS. Another danger with simulated time series is that injected signals
may be too simplistic or that the number of injected signals is incomplete. For
example, the inclusion of detailed systematic RV noise sources may have had a
direct affect the
survey's detection sensitivity. Another major source of potential inconsistency
is that the nature of detecting planets in the SLS-PS was based on an automated
detection algorithm intended to emulate the steps taken by a human when
searching for RV planets. Indeed the data flow from RV surveys is sufficiently
small that manual planet detection is manageable (unlike in large transit
surveys) and variances between human performance and the automated detection
algorithm from chapter~\ref{chap:BS} may result in a different planet yield than
was initially predicted. Overall, it would be an interesting exercise to
isolate which of these discrepancies contributes to the observed differences
between the predicted planet yield and the true planet yield following the
conclusion of the SLS-PS.

\section{Foreseen Improvements to the \texttt{RVFC}}
Recall that the Radial Velocity Follow-up Calculator (\texttt{RVFC}) is a tool
used to calculate the number of RV observations required to measure a transiting
planet's RV semi-amplitude $K$ at a desired level of precision given the properties
of the planet, the host star, and the RV spectrograph. The properties of the latter two
are required, in part, to compute the photon noise limited RV precision using
model spectra from which the RV information content can be quantified. However,
late K to M dwarf model spectra are known to be incomplete largely due to the
abundance of molecular transitions that are not well understood and thus lead to
discrepancies between empirical spectra of cool stars and their model atmospheres
\citep{passegger16,behmard19}. Updating the M dwarf model spectra within the
\texttt{RVFC} will improve the accuracy of the calculated $\sigma_{\gamma}$ values
and consequently the accuracy of the \texttt{RVFC} results for cool stars. \\

Another limiting factor to the accuracy of computed values of $\sigma_{\gamma}$
is the treatment of telluric contamination. Currently in the \texttt{RVFC}
regions of the spectral domain for which the vertically integrated atmospheric
transmission is below some user-defined threshold are omitted from the
calculation. As noted in Sect.~\ref{sect:tellurics}, these regions are often
wide in the infrared such that calculations of $\sigma_{\gamma}$ in near-IR
bands are likely underestimated relative to the values that could be obtained
if a more sophisticated treatment of telluric contamination was applied
\citep[e.g.][]{artigau14,bedell19}. Implementation of an accurate model of the
telluric spectrum and its subsequent subtraction from the observed spectrum
would significantly increase the usable amount of spectral information for stars
observed with near-IR spectrographs and would thus decrease values of
$\sigma_{\gamma}$ in the near-IR bringing them closer to typical values obtained
in the optical (see Fig.~\ref{fig:RVFCfig:sigRV}). \\

Another point of potential improvement to the accuracy of the \texttt{RVFC} is
to allow for custom window functions to be used. In the special case of planets
plus white noise in RV time series, the exact window function does not affect the
$K$ measurement precision \sigK{} as long as the time series approximately
samples the planet's orbital phase uniformly. However when correlated noise
persists, the form of the window function matters because of the factors
$t_i-t_j$ in the quasi-periodic covariance function (Eq.~\ref{eq:GpQp}).
Currently the \texttt{RVFC}
adopts a uniformly spaced window function for correlated noise calculations but
the option for users to define their own window functions that take into account
target visibility and observatory restrictions would be desirable.


\section{Improving our Physical Understanding of M dwarf Stellar Activity}
The Sun is unique in that its surface can be resolved with a variety of
observational diagnostics of its brightness, surface velocity, magnetic field strength,
and orientation distributions. When those observables are obtained
simultaneously with other time series that are obtainable for distant stars
(e.g. disk integrated photometry and RVs), then resolved structures on the solar
surface can be related to the other observables and inform models of solar
activity \citep{dumusque15,haywood16}. Numerous programs that I have recently
become involved with aim to observe a sample of M dwarfs with a similar
strategy. That is, to obtain contemporaneous optical and near-IR RVs along with
polarimetric diagnostics of bright M dwarfs spanning a range of stellar masses
and rotation periods. This large collaboration known as the RVxTESS program
has proposed to obtain those observations of M dwarfs within a suite of TESS
sectors as they are being observed with TESS. The goal of this and other
similar programs is to provide as many contemporaneous diagnostics of M dwarf
stellar activity in order to infer the physical nature of activity signals that
are seen in the RVs and that hinder our ability to detect low mass planets. \\

%In the sense that all models are incomplete a better understanding of the
%physical sources of stellar activity on M dwarfs will help inform any absent
%components in our RV models. 
Deepening our understanding of the physical sources of M dwarf stellar may also
be useful for modifying our GP models of stellar activity in that additional
covariance terms may be required or these correlated noise models may need to
be supplemented with other physical models of RV activity
\citep[e.g.][]{aigrain12,haywood14}. Another potential
outcome of these studies is to establish which observational diagnostics
are optimal in terms of informing RV activity models as I have discerned that
in practice, stellar photometry often provides the strongest constraints on RV
activity despite the photometric time series used throughout
chapters~\ref{chap:k2181} and~\ref{chap:k2182} not being contemporaneous with
the RV measurements.


\section{Detailing the Accuracy of RV Planet Models in the Presence of a GP}
Since some of the original implementations of GP models of correlated noise in
RV time series, the results have been widely accepted due to the ability of the
formalism to return precise planetary parameters in models that are favoured
over models lacking such a treatment of stellar activity
\citep{haywood14,rajpaul15} and to reconcile discrepant results from different
RV teams \citep{rajpaul17,cloutier19a}. What remains to be quantified is the accuracy of
the derived planetary parameters from RV models containing a GP activity model. For
example, the GP treatment of stellar activity is known to at times absorb some
of the planetary signal \citep[e.g.][]{ribas18}. Furthermore, GP activity models
that are untrained are at times disfavoured over models with trained GP models
as they lack the
constraining power provided by ancillary activity-sensitive time series like
photometry \citep{cloutier17b}. \\

One avenue worth considering to quantify the accuracy of planet parameters
derived from
RV models containing a GP activity model is to compute planet parameters
from a suite of synthetic RV time series for which the injected planet
parameters are known. Calculating the bias function as the difference between
the maximum a-posteriori $K$ (for example) and the injected $K$ for models with
and without a GP would inform the ways in which the GP biases our inference of
observable planetary parameters and consequently their physical properties.
Such a study would likely be complex as the nature of the bias would likely depend
on the exact form of the GP, its mean model (i.e. the planetary solution), and
sampling that are all unique for every system studied with RVs.
Inherent biases in the planetary mass-radius relation resulting from only
reporting high S/N planet mass detections has already been noted \citep{burt18}.
But whether or not the incompleteness of GP activity models is resulting in biased
planetary mass measurements, we will want known about it.


\section{Characterizing the Performance of \texttt{ORION}}
Although the TESS mission was not designed as a statistical mission to study
the bulk properties of the exoplanet population and subsets therein,
characterization of the sensitivity and false positive rate of transit detection
algorithms will enable planet occurrence rates to be derived from the primary
mission results. Particularly
for close-in planets where TESS is most sensitive due its short, 27 day fields.
However these planetary systems are still of particular interest given structure
that was recently detected in the occurrence rate of close-in planets around
Sun-like stars postulated to be the result of photoevaporation on the planetary
atmospheres \cite{owen13,fulton17,vaneylen18}. \\

A thorough suite of injection-recovery simulations using the \texttt{ORION}
transit detection code (see chapter~\ref{chap:orion}) can be used to
characterize the algorithm's detection sensitivity and systematic false positive
rate as a function of planetary orbital period and $r_p/R_s$. Application to the
TESS data will then allow for the occurrence rate of close-in planets around M
dwarfs to be calculated as TESS features an enhanced sensitivity to early-to-mid
M dwarfs compared to Kepler. Focusing on the detailed occurrence rates of these
planetary systems from TESS will enable the resolution of the radius valley for
M dwarf planetary systems and for its measured location and its slope with
orbital period to be compared to the results obtained for Sun-like stars in
various mass bins \citep{fulton18}.
