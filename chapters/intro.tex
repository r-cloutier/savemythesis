\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction: radial velocity studies of planets around small stars}

\section{Exoplanets}  \label{sect:exoplanets}
Since the first detection of an exo-solar planet around a main sequence star 
\citep{mayor95}
the quest to find and study additional planets outside of our own solar system 
has been met with much enthusiasm and success. In recent years, numerous 
purpose-built instruments
have been designed to detect exoplanets using a variety of methods each with
their own unique sensitivities and biases. 
Combining the results of multiple observational methods provides a nearly global
overview of the exoplanet population and thus provides insight into
the dominant pathways of planet formation and towards an understanding of how
common the conditions for life like our own are within our galaxy. \\

The results from many such dedicated exoplanet missions have been 
astounding. At the time of writing there were 3926 confirmed 
exoplanets\footnote{\url{https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/}; accessed on April 1, 2019.} 
with many more thousands of planet candidates. Furthermore, there 
exists an extensive diversity among planetary systems including the existence 
of certain exotic subsets of exoplanets for which analogs do not exist within 
our own solar system. Some of these extreme systems include i) the so-called hot 
Jupiters (e.g. 51 Pegasi b; \citealt{mayor95}, HD 189733b; \citealt{bouchy05}, 
\& HD 209458b; \citealt{mazeh99, charbonneau00}): 
gas giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding the mass of Jupiter  
but with orbital periods of $\lesssim 10$ days, ii) circumbinary planets (e.g. 
Kepler-16b; \citealt{doyle11}): 
planets that orbit stellar binaries, and iii) the most common planet types
in the local universe \citep{petigura13}, namely super-Earths and sub-Neptunes whose
radii span $\sim 1.5-4$ R$_{\oplus}$ and over a wide range of orbital separations
(e.g. GJ 1214b; \citealt{charbonneau09}, Kepler 440b; \citealt{torres15}, \&
K2-18b; \citealt{foremanmackey15a,montet15}).


\section{M dwarf stars} \label{sect:Mdwarfs}
The majority of the work presented throughout this thesis focuses on planetary systems
around M dwarf stars. M dwarfs embody the low mass end of the main sequence
phase of stellar evolution and dominate the stellar initial mass function
\citep{kroupa01} which, when
coupled with their extended main sequence lifetimes, causes M dwarfs to dominate the
spectral type distribution throughout the galaxy while outnumbering Sun-like stars
4:1 in the solar neighbourhood \citep{winters15}. In addition to being plentiful
within the nearby Universe, M dwarf stars are known to frequently host multi-planet
systems of Earth to Neptune-sized planets \citep{dressing15a,gaidos16} that
are more easily detectable in radial velocity around M dwarfs than around Sun-like stars
due to the their lower masses (see Sect.~\ref{sect:K}). What's more is that the habitable zone
around M dwarfs \citep{kasting93,kopparapu13}, where the probability of hosting potentially
habitable planets is maximized due to the temperate planetary equilibrium temperatures there,
exists at much smaller orbital separations than around Sun-like stars thus making the
characterization of temperate M dwarf planets a much more tractable problem observationally. \\

A critical caveat to the aforementioned benefits of focusing on planet searches around M dwarfs
is that many of these stars tend to be active (see Sect.~\ref{sect:activity}). This fact not only
deters the prospect of finding signs of life like us on M dwarf planets but it also inhibits
our ability to obtain accurate and precise empirical parameters of their planetary systems.
Overcoming this problem is one of the primary topics of this thesis.

  
\section{Methods of Detecting Exoplanets} \label{sect:detection}
Numerous methods for the direct or indirect detection of exoplanets
have been successfully demonstrated or proposed. All such methods provide complementary
access to the exoplanetary parameter space thus enabling a unique view of the exoplanet
population. A non-exhaustive list of prominent exoplanet discovery methods follows and are
visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:detection}. \\

\begin{figure}

  \caption[Methods of exoplanet detection and characterization.]
      {Examples of observables for exoplanet detections using A)
    the radial velocity method \citep{mayor95}, B) planetary transits
    \citep{charbonneau09}, C) direct imaging \citep{currie14},
    D) transit timing variations \citep{ballard11},
    E) gravitational microlensing \citep{beaulieu06}, and
    F) astrometry \citep{sahlmann13}.}
  \label{fig:detection}
\end{figure}

\emph{Radial velocities}: the measurement of variations in the Doppler shift of star
around the barycenter of its planetary system due to the gravitational influence of
planetary-mass companions. This method is used to measure the planet-star orbital separation
and places a lower limit on the planet's mass. The radial velocity
method favours the detection of massive, short-period planets around inactive stars
(see Sect.~\ref{sect:rv} for more details). \\

\emph{Photometric transits}: monitoring the brightness of a star over time and
searching for periodically reoccurring brightness dips due to the occultation of the star
by an orbiting planet. This method is highly complementary to the radial velocity method
as it measures the planet's radius and orbital inclination where the latter can be
used to break the mass-inclination degeneracy suffered by radial velocity planet
detections. The recovery of radial velocity planet masses and planet radii from transit observations
together provide
views of planetary bulk densities that can be used to distinguish predominantly
rocky planets from planets with significant fractions of their sizes in gaseous envelopes.
The transit method is the most successful planet detection method as a single
wide-field camera can be used to monitor many stars simultaneously and continuously.
However, this method requires planets to have nearly edge-on orbits relative to the observer
and thus favours the detection of close-in giant planets orbiting small stars. \\

\emph{Direct imaging}: spatially resolving planets from their bright host stars and thus the
direct detection of photons originating from the planet. The resulting planetary luminosity
measurements can be compared to forward models of planetary
evolution to infer planet masses and possible formation pathways \citep{marley07}.
Multi-epoch observations can also reveal the nature of planetary orbits \citep{wang18}.
Due to the extremely small planet/star contrasts required to directly detect planetary companions,
direct imaging favours the detection of young massive planets on wide orbits. \\

\emph{Transit timing variations}: or TTVs, represent deviations in the expected transit
times of a transiting planet under the assumption of a linear ephemeris. Such deviations
may be attributed to an unseen planetary companion whose gravitational influence on the
transiting planet is observable either through close encounters or mean motion resonances.
The amplitude and periodicity of a transiting planet's TTVs can be used to constrain the mass
and orbital period of the perturbing planet although a mass-eccentricity degeneracy exists
planet pairs close to mean motion resonances \citep{lithwick12}. \\

\emph{Gravitational microlensing}:
offers a unique method for probing the planet population out to large distances
within the Milky Way as the detected photons do not originate from the planetary system itself
but rather from a distant bright source. As the gravitational field of a
foreground star (i.e. the lens) occults a distant bright source, the source appears to
brighten as a result of the gravitational lensing effect. In the case for which the lens' gravitational
potential deviates significantly from radial symmetry because of a gravitational anomaly induced by a
planetary companion, that inhomogeneity in the gravitational field of the lens will disrupt the smoothness
of the field and cause an anomalous brightening that reveals the presence of a co-moving companion with
a measurable mass. One drawback of this method however is that observations of the same planetary
system are not repeatable due to the very precise alignment of the source and lens that is required. \\

\emph{Astrometry}: is similar to the radial velocity method wherein a planetary-mass companion
causes its host star to periodically wobble. The astrometry method is unique to the radial velocity
method as the observed variations occur in the plane of the sky in position space, rather than in velocity
space. This method is used to measure the orbital separation of a
star and planet and measure the planet's mass. Because the variation in the star's position
needs to be resolved, the astrometry method favours nearby planetary systems with massive
planets on wide-orbits. \\


\section{Exoplanet detection via Stellar Radial Velocity} \label{sect:rv}
\subsection{Radial velocity curves}
The radial velocity (RV) method of detecting and characterizing exoplanets is largely
the focus of the work presented herein and so here I provide an overview of its formalism. \\

The RV method represents a simple 
application of Newton's third law: `for every action, there is an equal 
and opposite reaction'. In this case, the presence of a planetary companion around a 
host star displaces the barycenter of that two-body system (i.e. the centre-of-mass) from the
centre of the star itself. Because of this, a star with a sole companion 
will execute a keplerian orbit about the system's barycenter. The radial velocity of such a star
%as seen by any observer whose line of sight is not exactly orthogonal to the star's
%orbit normal,
is

\begin{equation}
V_r(t) = \gamma_0 + K[\cos{(\nu(t,P,T_0) + \omega)} + e\cos{\omega})],
\label{eq:rv}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t$ is the independent time coordinate, $\gamma_0$ is the systemic velocity of
the star relative to the observer, $K$ is the semi-amplitude of the RV variation,
$P$ is the orbital period of the star and planet, 
$T_0$ is the reference epoch or time of inferior conjunction, and
the orbital elements $e$ and $\omega$ are the orbital eccentricity and argument of
periastron respectively. Note that $\omega$ is undefined for circular orbits with
$e=0$ and is assigned the conventional value of $\pi/2$ in such a scenario.
Eq.~\ref{eq:rv} is known as the keplarian orbital solution.
The true anomaly $\nu(t,P,T_0)$ defines the position of the star on its orbit 
relative to the argument of periastron and in the direction of motion. It is derived 
from another angular parameter, the eccentric anomaly $E(t)$. The eccentric 
anomaly can be solved for using the mean anomaly $M(t)$ according to 
Kepler's equation

\begin{equation}
M(t) = E(t)-e\sin{E(t)},
\label{eq:kepler} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where the mean anomaly is

\begin{equation}
M(t) = \frac{2\pi}{P} (t-\tau_{\mathrm{peri}}), 
\end{equation}

\noindent and $\tau_{\mathrm{peri}}$ is the epoch of 
pericenter passage. Because Eq.~\ref{eq:kepler} does not have a closed-form 
solution, in practice it is solved using iterative numerical techniques. 
Examples of keplerian orbits using Eq.~\ref{eq:rv} are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rv} 
for two 5 Earth mass planets each with an orbital period of 2 days around a 0.2 M$_{\odot}$ 
star. The first planet is on a perfectly circular orbit and therefore induces a purely
sinusoidal RV variation on the host star while the second planet's eccentricity is 0.3 and
exhibits a RV variation that clearly differs from sinusoidal with the addition of the second
cosine term in Eq.~\ref{eq:rv}. \\

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \animategraphics[width=\textwidth,controls,loop]{150}{figures/RVcurve_}{1}{49}
  \caption[Animation of observed radial velocities for different orbital configurations.]
      {??An animation of the orbits of two (non-interacting) planets of equal
    mass and on 2 day orbits around a 0.2 solar mass star. The first planet has a circular
    keplerian orbit ($e=0$) while the orbit of the second exhibits some ellipticity with
    $e=0.3$. The lower panel depicts the corresponding RV variation induced on the host star
    by each planet independently.}
  \label{fig:rv}
\end{figure}

The keplarian orbital solution is valid in the absence of dynamical 
perturbations to the two-body system. For keplerian orbits, only the true anomaly in
Eq.~\ref{eq:rv} varies with time. However,
if additional bodies are present in the system such as in circumbinary  
systems or in high multiplicity planetary systems, then the parameters in 
Eq.~\ref{eq:rv} need not be fixed and we instead refer to the measured orbit as the 
osculating orbit that may vary between orbital cycles. Note that if the timescale 
for perturbations to the stellar orbital solution is comparable to or less than the 
time interval over which RV observations are obtained, then the keplarian 
orbital solution is an insufficient description of the observations and one must consider
a more complicated treatment of the dynamics typically in the form of N-body simulations.


\subsection{Fundamental planet parameters from the radial velocity method} \label{sect:K}
If we consider the simplest planetary system containing a star and a planet, each body will 
orbit their common centre-of-mass (COM) whose position vector is

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{COM}} = \frac{M_s \mathbf{r}_s + m_p \mathbf{r}_p}{M_s + m_p},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the stellar and planetary masses respectively and
$\mathbf{r}_s$ and $\mathbf{r}_p$ are their position vectors. 
Let us now take a barycentric view of this two-body system such that the 
COM coordinate is located at the origin ($|\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{COM}}|=0$). Further
assuming circular orbits (i.e. $e=0$) and working 
in absolute scalar terms, the orbital distances of the star and planet are  
related via 

\begin{equation}
a_s M_s = a_p m_p,
\label{eq:com}
\end{equation}
  
\noindent where we have written $|\mathbf{r}_s|=a_s$ and 
$|\mathbf{r}_p|=a_p$. For a circular orbit, the stellar velocity around the COM has
the constant value

\begin{equation}
v_s = \frac{2\pi a_s}{P}.
\label{eq:velocity}
\end{equation}

\noindent As the star orbits the COM the maximum observed radial velocity of the star
is realized when the magnitude of the star's radial velocity vector
equals its velocity $v_s$. At these points in the orbit, $V_r(t)=\text{max}(V_r(t))=v_s=K$.
Because the RV curve, and hence $K$, is observable, 
we can relate $K$ to the masses of the star and planet by combining the velocity 
equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:velocity}) with the COM equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:com})
and Kepler's third law:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{max}(V_r(t)) = K &= \frac{2\pi a_s}{P}, \\
&= \frac{2\pi}{P} \left( \frac{m_p}{M_s} \right) a_p, \\
&= \frac{2\pi}{P} \left( \frac{m_p}{M_s} \right) \left( \frac{GM_s}{4\pi^2} \right)^{1/3} P^{2/3}, \\
&= \left( \frac{2\pi G}{M_s^2 P} \right)^{1/3} m_p. \label{eq:K1}
\end{align}

Eq.~\ref{eq:K1} contains two quantities that are directly observable from the RV time series.
Namely, the orbital period $P$ and semi-amplitude $K$. Observers will often seek an independent
constraint on the stellar mass $M_s$ from say the comparison of the stellar spectrum to
spectral templates of known stellar mass from stellar evolution models
\citep[e.g.][]{muirhead12} or from
empirical relations between optical or near-IR stellar luminosities and dynamically
measured stellar masses \citep[e.g.][]{benedict16,mann19}. Prior knowledge of the
stellar mass enables the mass of the planetary companion to be inferred from RV time series
using Eq.~\ref{eq:K1}.
The uncertainties in the resulting planet mass 
measurement are typically dominated by the noise in the dataset which directly affects the
measurement precision of $P$ and $K$. Additional uncertainties in $m_p$ are also introduced by
the uncertainty in $M_s$ which motivates the need to develop a detailed understanding of
fundamental stellar parameters to enable precise exoplanet measurements. \\

Looking more closely at Eq.~\ref{eq:K1} we can see that the RV semi-amplitude scales 
linearly with planet mass but has a negative scaling with stellar mass and orbital 
period. This makes sense because the RV effect is a manifestation of a gravitational effect.
An increased perturbing mass (i.e. $m_p$) will result in an increased perturbation to the 
central body which itself becomes more difficult to perturb if more massive. Also, the 
effect weakens as the distance between the two bodies is increased (i.e. larger $P$). The 
RV method therefore has a natural observational bias towards massive, 
close-in planets around low mass stars as the combination of these parameters will maximize the
RV signal and increase the chances of that signal being detected above the noise (see
Sect.~\ref{sect:error}). This explains why the first planets to be detected with the
RV method were hot Jupiters \citep[e.g.][]{mayor95}.
%For reference, the RV semi-amplitude that the Earth 
%induces on the Sun is $\sim 9$ cm s$^{-1}$ whereas the $\sim 300$ times more massive Jupiter
%induces a $\sim 12$ \mps{} effect despite having a factor of $\sim 5$ wider orbit.

\subsection{Caveats to Eq.~\ref{eq:K1}}
In the derivation of the RV semi-amplitude (Eq.~\ref{eq:K1}) we have neglected two 
important geometric effects. The first is that of eccentricity which, if non-zero, 
causes the stellar velocity to vary throughout its orbit such that
$\text{d}v_s/\text{d}t \ne 0$. Instead $\mathrm{max}(V_r(t)) > 2\pi a_s/P$ 
because the conservation of angular momentum requires that $v_s(\tau_{\text{peri}})$ 
be greater than elsewhere on the orbit. The corresponding correction 
factor to Eq.~\ref{eq:K1} is $(1-e^2)^{-1/2}$. \\

The second effect is that of inclination. When attempting to measure the planetary 
mass from RVs the orbital inclination of the planetary orbit\footnote{Orbital 
inclination is conventionally measured  relative 
to the plane of the sky; i.e. an edge-on orbit has $i=90^{\circ}$.} is degenerate with
$m_p$ and is entirely unknown unless the planet has an a-priori measurement of its orbital
inclination from either transit or astrometric observations. But the majority of planets are
neither transiting nor induce a resolvable astrometric variation and thus have unknown
orbital inclinations. For these planets, RV measurements 
are only sensitive to a mass lower limit $m_p\sin{i}$ rather than to the absolute planet mass.
The $\sin{i}$ correction factor also illustrates that an RV signal is only non-zero when
the observer's orientation is not exactly orthogonal to the normal of the star's orbital plane;
i.e. face-on orientations with $i=0$. \\

The inclusion of these correction factors gives a more complete description of the RV semi-amplitude
compared to Eq.~\ref{eq:K1}: 

\begin{equation}
K = \left( \frac{2\pi G}{M_s^2 P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{m_p \sin{i}}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}. 
\label{eq:K2}
\end{equation}

\section{Measuring Radial Velocities} \label{sect:spectrograph}
\subsection{Stellar Spectroscopy}
Radial velocity variations induced by planetary companions cause the star to become 
periodically Doppler shifted. These wavelength shifts can be detected using high resolution 
spectroscopy as spectral features originating from the stellar photosphere are shifted from
their rest wavelength $\lambda_{\text{rest}}$ as the star's velocity changes along the
line-of-sight according to 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{V_r}{c},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta \lambda = \lambda_{\text{obs}}-\lambda_{\text{rest}}$ and
$\lambda_{\text{obs}}$ is the observed wavelength of the spectral features. 
In practice, RV shifts are often measured from the cross-correlation of 
the observed stellar spectrum with a master empirical spectrum or template mask
that is shifted in velocity space to map their correlation over relative velocities
\citep{astudillodefru15}. The resulting RV precision is enhanced when the individual velocities
of many lines can be averaged. This makes precision RV measurements especially tractable for M
dwarfs as they exhibit a plethora of 
spectral lines that become more abundant towards later type stars.
A sample of infrared spectra of early-to-late M dwarfs 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra} to demonstrate their wealth of absorption features
\citep{rayner09}.  \\

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\hsize]{figures/Mdwarf_spectra.png}
\caption[Near-IR spectra of early-to-late M dwarfs.]
        {Medium resolution spectra ($R=\lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 2000$)
          for four early-to-late M dwarfs in the J band (\emph{top}),
  H band (\emph{middle}), and K$_{\text{S}}$ band (\emph{bottom}) from the SpeX spectrograph
  at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. \label{fig:spectra}}
\end{figure}

The aforementioned
spectroscopic measurements are made using a stabilized spectrograph at high spectral resolution
($R=\lambda / \Delta \lambda$) that contains a grating to 
diffract or spatially disperse the incoming source light into its various colour components.
Echelle spectrographs in particular include an additional high order grating that separates the
light into spectral orders that are subsequently cross-dispersed spatially onto the detector. The
dispersed spectral orders create the observed stellar spectrum (Fig.~\ref{fig:harps}).
After 1D spectral extraction, the spectrum is cross-correlated with the aforementioned master spectrum
or template mask wherein prominent lines 
are averaged to create the cross-correlation function (CCF) of the star at the epoch of 
observation. Traditionally, the CCF is typically fit with a Gaussian line profile whose best-fit mean 
is equal to the measured radial velocity \citep{pepe02}. It should be noted however that the net
convective blueshift in stellar photospheres causes the native CCF to be asymmetric rather
than purely Gaussian even in the absence of surface inhomogeneities \citep{gray89}.
Active regions on the stellar surface arising 
from the presence of magnetic fields can have additional effects on the observed CCF 
causing the line profile to exhibit additional and localized non-Gaussianities. 
These distortions can in principle be used to model stellar activity in cases for which the distortions
can be detected at high signal-to-noise and their origin dominates the astrophysical RV budget (as opposed
to being due to systematic effects). \\

\subsection{Radial Velocity Error Budget Overview} \label{sect:error}
The complete error budget when conducting precision RV measurements features many contributing factors.
Among these are instrument/facility limitations, the fundamental photon noise limit, imperfect corrections
of telluric contamination, and astrophysical noise. Here we review the RV error budget
with a particular focus on stellar activity as it pertains to the work presented in this thesis.

\subsubsection{Instrumentation Challenges}
RV spectrographs have an inherent RV precision that is set by a multitude of individual error sources
that hinder a user's ability to measure infinitesimally precise
RVs \citep{podgorski14,halverson16}.
These issues are intrinsic to the experimental hardware and their relative contributions
vary significantly between instruments with often not a single source of error dominating the instrumental
error budget. \\

A non-exhaustive list of prominent issues with RV spectrographs includes 

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item thermal stability,
  \item pressure stability,
  \item wavelength calibration,
  \item vibration control,
  \item drift control,
  \item detector imperfections (i.e. readout noise, intrapixel quantum efficiencies, etc),
  \item scattered light,
  \item fibre modal noise,
  \item tracking errors,
  \item focus errors,
  \item etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
  
\noindent The aforementioned RV error sources arise from the design and operation of the
instrument and telescope facility. As such, their mitigation is set by the hardware specifications
and cannot be significantly improved by post processing. These challenges associated with building
state-of-the-art RV instrumentation are not the focus of
this thesis but it is important to note their contributions to the overall RV error budget as together
they set a limit to the highest possible RV precision attainable with a given instrument.

\subsubsection{Photon noise limit}
The photon noise limit represents the fundamental limit to the RV measurement precision that can
be obtained from a stellar spectrum $A_i$ where $i$ is the index over wavelength elements.
The photon noise limited RV precision from \cite{bouchy01} is

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\gamma} = \frac{c}{\text{S/N} \cdot Q}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $c$ is the speed of light, S/N is the signal-to-noise of the spectrum over its
complete spectral domain, and

\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_i W_i}}{\sqrt{\sum_i A_i}}
\end{equation}

\noindent is known as the quality factor and represents the density of RV information content
in the spectrum $A_i$ measured in photoelectrons. The weighting function is given by

\begin{equation}
  W_i = \left( \frac{\lambda_i^2}{A_i} \right) \left( \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial \lambda_i} \right)^2.
  \label{eq:weight}
\end{equation}

By the dependence of $\sigma_{\gamma}$ on the first spectral derivative of the observed spectrum
(Eq.~\ref{eq:weight}), it is clear that
high S/N spectra with a high density of sharp features provide the
best possible RV precision. Because the sharpness of the lines is important, obtaining high
resolution spectra has a direct benefit on minimizing $\sigma_{\gamma}$. Similarly, stars
with low levels of collisional and rotational broadening (i.e. low $\log{g}$ and \vsini{)} are
favourable targets for minimizing $\sigma_{\gamma}$. Also because line density is important, cooler stars
or stars with a high metallicity are favourable as they exhibit more molecular and metal features over which
counting errors can be minimized. Fig.~\ref{fig:sigrv} demonstrates these dependencies over the spectral
bands $UBVRIYJHK_{\text{S}}$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sigRV_grid.png}
  \caption[Doppler information content over spectral band passes and stellar properties.]
      {Distributions of the photon noise limited RV precision in the $UBVRIYJHK_{\text{S}}$
    bands and as a function of spectral resolution, $\log{g}$, metallicity, \vsini{,}
    and stellar effective temperature. The distribution shown in each subpanel is marginalized
    over all parameters not depicted on either of the panel's axes and is therefore not
    representative of true $\sigma_{\gamma}$ values particularly in the near-IR bands
    in which telluric contamination is not properly treated.}
  \label{fig:sigrv}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Telluric contamination} \label{sect:tellurics}
In addition to error floors arising from the instrumentation and the photon noise limit,
other physical sources of RV errors exist that need to be accounted for in the post-processing
software. One example is the effect
of telluric contamination of the stellar spectrum by spectral features originating from Earth's
atmosphere. Because all high precision RV experiments to date are executed from the ground
the incoming starlight must traverse much of the Earth's atmosphere at which time telluric
absorption and emission features become
imprinted on the incident spectrum. This effect is much more prominent in the infrared where
the atmosphere becomes more opaque over wider spectral bands than in the visible due
in large part to absorption bands by various greenhouse gases such as H$_2$O
(Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission}). In the visible, small regions
in wavelength space that are known to be contaminated by tellurics can be simply masked without
significant loss of RV content. Whereas this method if applied to near-IR spectrographs 
eliminates such a large fraction of the available RV information that it effectively negates the
benefits of developing near-IR RV spectrographs at all.
Instead, near-IR RVs must rely on more sophisticated methods of telluric spectrum extraction and
removal based on atmospheric transmission models \citep[e.g.][]{vacca03,bertaux14}
and/or data-driven methods \citep[e.g.][]{artigau14,bedell19}.

            dominated by O$_2$, O$_3$, and H$_2$O while the near-IR wavelengths feature strong H$_2$O absorption
            bands in addition to other strong absorbers such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, OCS, and N$_2$O.

  %  $YJHK_{\text{S}}$ bands.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stellar activity} \label{sect:activity}
There exists a variety of physical processes in the photospheres and chromospheres of stars that
can lead to temporally correlated RV signals that are collectively
referred to as \emph{stellar activity}. Alternatively, activity sources that act on short timescales
(i.e. seconds to minutes) are sometimes referred to as stellar jitter.
Particularly in RV planet studies, stellar activity
signals are the bane of observers searching for sub-Neptune-sized planets because activity signals
can mask and in certain instances even mimic the planetary signals of interest. \\

Depending on the exact physical process, these
signals can have widely differing timescales and manifestations in
spectroscopic, photometric, and polarimetry observations. In general, activity
signals are also wavelength dependent unlike Doppler variations induced by
planetary companions \citep{tal-or18}. Ancillary time series to RV measurements
derived from any of the aforementioned observations may therefore be used to
disentangle stellar activity from achromatic Doppler shifts induced by a companion.
Such observables include spectroscopic activity indicators such as the $H\alpha$ and
\caii{} H \& K indices that are magnetically sensitive features originating from the hot stellar
chromosphere, line deformation diagnostics (e.g. CCF shape parameters; \citealt{boisse11},
line-by-line analyses \citealt{davis17,dumusque18}), plus Doppler imaging of the stellar surface
\citep{hebrard16} (see Sect.~\ref{sect:indicators} for details). 
%Some observables as they pertain to specific studies presented herein will
%be discussed in further detail as required. \\

Examples of sources of stellar activity are summarized below
while a brief overview is given in Table~\ref{table:activity}. \\

\emph{Flares}: magnetically active stars can undergo energetic flares or coronal mass
ejections originating from the stellar atmosphere. The exact flare physics
in M dwarfs remains uncertain but clearly requires strong magnetic fields
that can be sustained by turbulent convective motions and rotation
\citep{browning08}. Flare events are easily identifiable as they
exhibit a characteristically rapid increase in brightness (or in the intensity
of certain emission lines; e.g. Ca II, He I, H$\alpha$, etc. \citealt{schmidt12})
followed by an exponential decay over hours. Because RV
measurements affected by flares can be easily identified by the characteristic
line intensity spike over short timescales, such measurements are commonly
removed from planet searches \citep{reiners09}. \\

\emph{Stellar Oscillations}:
small scale mechanical perturbations to the internal stellar structure
can give rise to oscillation modes. If not damped, these oscillations
can propagate through the stellar interior before rebounding at the surface
of the star thus creating observable pulses in brightness and in the RVs at a
few \mps{} and on timescales of a few to tens of minutes \citep{bedding01}. 
This phenomenon is predominantly observed in Sun-like and post main sequence stars.
Due to the short timescale of
pulsation variations in RV measurements of pulsating stars, the corresponding
jitter is often mitigated with sufficiently long exposure times
\citep{lovis05, dumusque11a}. \\


\emph{Granulation}:
stars with outer convection zones like the Sun and M dwarfs exhibit granulation patterns
at their surfaces. The granulation pattern is the result
of convection cells penetrating the surface; hot fluid parcels rising to the surface before
cooling and descending back into the stellar interior (see Fig.~\ref{fig:granulation}).
These patches of hot rising fluid are therefore brighter than the surrounding regions of cold
descending fluid. Furthermore, the relative fractional coverage of a star's surface by rising
fluid parcels is in general greater than that of descending ones as evidenced in
Fig.~\ref{fig:granulation}.
Along the line-of-sight, the RV component of photons emitted by the rising parcels at the
photospheric boundary will be blueshifted whereas the receding fluid within the
`intergranular lanes' will be redshifted. The domination of the stellar
surface area by hot parcels results in a granulated star having a net \emph{convective
  blueshift} that in turn creates an asymmetry in the disk-integrated spectral line profile
with additional power at blueshifted velocities. The effect of granulation is also known
to decrease towards cool M dwarf stars \citep{dumusque11a,meunier17}. \\

    Telescope. The bright regions are the result of rising hot fluid parcels whereas the cooler,
    `intergranular lanes' reveal where the gas has cooled and descends back into the solar
    interior. (Image credit: Hinode JAXA/NASA/PPARC)}
  \label{fig:granulation}
\end{figure}


The short lifetimes of typical granules
\citep[$\sim 10$ minutes;][]{hall08,gilliland11} implies that brightness variability of the
surface varies on a similar timescale. However, `supergranules' may also persist over longer
timescales albeit with smaller RV contributions \citep[$\lesssim 1$ \mps{;}][]{rincon17}
%Such variations have been measured using high cadence photometry
%\citep[e.g.][]{gilliland11}.
The corresponding RV jitter is dependent on the relative velocity of convective
cells across the stellar surface. Noting that the relative sizes of granules varies over time, so
too does the resulting RV jitter whose net effect (hot and cold regions partially
cancel each other) is typically at the level of a few \mps{} \citep{lindegren03}. \\
%This level of radial
%velocity jitter has been observed on both the Sun \parencite{kuhn83} and on $\alpha$ Cen A
%\parencite{kjeldsen99}. \\

\emph{Active Regions}:
like the Sun, the photospheres of active M dwarfs are littered with active regions such
as dark photospheric starspots, hot faculae, or plages in the chromosphere. Indeed,
the activity signals from active regions appear to dominate the RV activity budget on M dwarfs
\citep{lindegren03}. These localized regions of either
hot or cold gas relative to the surrounding photosphere become trapped by magnetic field loops reconnecting
with the stellar surface. Active regions create a temporally evolving
RV signal and spectral line profile distortion due to their distinct emitting temperatures and their orientation
as they rotate in and out of view (see Fig.~\ref{fig:starspot}). In the Sun, these structures
have long been known to be associated with strong local magnetic fields as evidenced by the observed
Zeeman splitting of lines emitted from these active regions \citep{hale08}. \\

      {An snapshot example of a spotted stellar photosphere and its effect on the disk-integrated
    spectral line profile. The cool spots depicted here disrupt the symmetry of the
    line profile according to the temperature difference between the spot and
    unspotted photosphere at its position on the stellar disk.

  \label{fig:starspot}
\end{figure}

The activity timescale from active regions is modulated by the stellar rotation. The stellar rotation
period \prot{} can often be measured for active stars with non-zero
inclination from the quasi-periodicity of their photometric variability.
The spectroscopic method of measuring a star's rotation state is done by measuring the projected
stellar rotation velocity \vsini{\footnote{Slowly rotating stars with correspondingly small \vsini{}
    values may not be detectable with insufficient spectral resolution. In such cases, only an upper
    limit on \vsini{} can be measured.}} via the rotational broadening
of its spectral features \citep{gray08}.
Because active regions are associated with magnetic activity and stellar
magnetic fields require rotation in order to be sustained over long timescales, rapidly rotating
late-type stars tend to be more magnetically active.
Fig.~\ref{fig:activity} demonstrates that the fraction of active M dwarfs is sustained at slower
rotation states in later M dwarfs than in early M dwarfs and that the activity fraction in general 
decreases as the stars spin-down via magnetized braking from stellar winds
\citep{skumanich72}. A measure of stellar rotation can therefore be used as a first-order
indicator of a star's activity level. \\

  \caption[M dwarf activity fraction versus spectral type and stellar rotation.]

    dwarfs. An individual star's activity flag is based on the ratio of its H$\alpha$ emission
    luminosity to its bolometric luminosity.
    The activity fraction of stars is seen to decrease as rotation slows although mid-to-late M
    dwarfs can maintain a higher activity fraction than early-to-mid M dwarfs within a given
    \prot{} bin. \citep[Image credit:][]{west15}}
  \label{fig:activity}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:rotation} depicts the rotation period
distribution of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood \citep{newton16a} and in the Kepler
field up to \prot{} $< 70$ days \citep{mcquillan13a}.
Two distinct populations exist, namely a rapidly
rotating population (\prot{} $\lesssim 3$ days) and a slowly rotating population
(\prot{} $\gtrsim 50$ days). It has been proposed that these two populations
have a distinct range of ages with
the slow rotators belonging to an older stellar population based on their galactic
kinematics \citep{irwin11} and resulting from magnetic-braking over time.
Indeed, a fairly robust relation exists for GK and early M dwarf stars between stellar
mass, age, and rotation \citep[gyrochronology;][]{barnes03}. \\

    population of fast (\prot{} $\lesssim 3$ days) and slowly (\prot{} $\gtrsim 50$ days)
    rotating M dwarfs with a dearth of stars at intermediate \prot{.} These features are
    thought to be indicative of two distinctly aged populations. 
    \citep[Image credit:][]{newton16a}}

\end{figure}

Another important point regarding active regions is that their lifetimes are often
one to a few stellar rotation timescales with those timescales being extended for later
type stars \citep{giles17}. That is that active regions on M dwarfs appear to be long-lived
compared to around Sun-like stars.
The evolution of active regions over rotation cycles implies that the associated
stellar activity can vary on similar timescales. %As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:rotation},
M dwarf active region lifetimes can range from days to months and given that those
lifetimes are primarily determined by the active region sizes as they
diffuse into the photosphere \citep{berdyugina05}, larger volume/surface ratios results in
longer lifetimes \citep{petrovay97,giles17}. The lifetimes of M dwarf active regions will
have important implications when attempting to model stellar activity in RV time series in
subsequent chapters. \\

\emph{Gravitational redshift}:
the contraction and expansion of stars throughout their evolution will introduce an RV activity
signal. Even small variations at the level of hundredths of a percent will have manifestations
at the 10 cm s$^{-1}$ level which is sufficient to mask an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star
\citep{lindegren03}. In low mass stars, the suppression of surface convection by strong magnetic fields
may result in stellar radius fluctuations and consequently an activity signal due to gravitational
redshift that varies on the timescale of variations in the star's magnetic field strength of days to
years \citep{cegla12}. \\


\emph{Magnetic Cycles}:
the Sun undergoes a long-term magnetic cycle with an 11 year period as measured by the
fractional coverage or number of sunspots and faculae visible on its surface \citep{hathaway10}.
At solar maximum, the 
peak in magnetic activity over the solar cycle, the Sun i) experiences strong prominences
and coronal mass ejections and ii) contains a large number of active regions that contribute
to a higher level of activity in RV time series as well as in other observables
\citep{maunder04}. Long-term magnetic activity cycles have been observed in long-baseline
spectroscopic monitoring programs \citep{santos10}. From solar observations, the flux in the
\caii{} H \& K lines are known to correlate with the number of sunspots. Numerous results from
similar surveys have 
demonstrated that the majority of Sun-like stars do exhibit magnetic activity cycles
with a range of periods from $\sim 7-30$ years \citep{duncan91,lockwood97,balinunas98}. \\

As it pertains to RV planet searches, activity cycles have been 
observed and characterized in Sun-like stars \citep{baliunas95}. 
Even when complete cycles remain unresolved, subsections of the cyclic trends have been seen in
certain mature RV surveys to be correlated with
the \Rhk{} spectroscopic activity indicator \citep[e.g.][]{lovis11}.
A common tactic to correct for such long-term activity trends in RV time series is to use a linear
relation between the RVs and the contemporaneous \Rhk{} time series although residual jitter
often persists \citep{dumusque12}. The corresponding RV signal from magnetic cycles can reach tens of
\mps{.} Luckily, when searching for
planets whose orbital timescales are much less than the period of the star's magnetic cycle, the
corresponding activity is not often a major concern. \\
