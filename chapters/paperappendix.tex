\chapter[Appendix]{Appendix: summaries of additional papers not presented
  in this thesis}

The following is chronological list of papers
that include direct contributions from myself and have not been included as
chapters in this thesis. My lead author papers are accompained by a brief paper
summary whereas papers for which I was a contributing author are accompanied by
a description of my contribution.

\section{Prospects for Detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect of
  Earth-like Planets: the test case of TRAPPIST-1b and c \citep{cloutier16a}}
The Rossiter-McLauglin (RM) effect, or spectroscopic transit, is an observable
effect that is sensitive to the sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\beta$ of a
planet's orbital plane relative to the host star's spin axis.
The measurement of $\beta$ may
be used to inform formation models and planet dynamical histories although it
has yet to be measured for any terrestrial-sized exoplanet. 
In this paper, which followed shortly after the discovery of at least three
terrestrial-sized planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 ultra-cool dwarf
\citep{gillon16}, we
argued that the two innermost planets represent ideal targets for being among
the first terrestrial-sized exoplanets with a detection of the RM effect.
Due to the small size of TRAPPIST-1, its short rotation period, and its
relatively low level of activity compared to other ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect
the semi-amplitudes of the TRAPPIST-1b and c RM effects to be $\sim 40-50$
\mps{} which is an order of magnitude greater than the amplitude of the
Dopppler reflex motion induced by the planets on their host star.
Through simulations of the RM effect, we showed that if the planets are
well-aligned then $\beta$ can be measured with a precision of
$\lesssim 10^{\circ}$ in an RV time series with typical measurement
uncertainties of 2 \mps{.}


\section{On the Radial Velocity Detection of Additional Planets in Transiting,
  Slowly Rotating M-dwarf Systems: The Case of GJ 1132 \citep{cloutier17a}}
M dwarfs are known to frequently host multi-planet systems such that we can
reasonably expect to find additional planets with RVs around M dwarfs with at
least one known transiting planet. In this paper we focused on one such
system, namely the nearby mid-M dwarf GJ 1132 which hosts a small transiting
planet and is amenable to deep RV follow-up. We created synthetic RV time series
by injecting planets from the empirical M dwarf occurrence rates plus physical
models of stellar activity. We then applied our GP formalism for modelling
stellar activity (Sect.~\ref{sect:gp}) to attempt to recover those planets.
From these calculations we compute our sensitivity to detecting additional
planets in the GJ 1132 planetary system as a function of the number of RV
measurements. We show that at 1 \mps{} precision, $\sim 50$\% of non-transiting
planets from the expected planet population can be detected with $\sim 50$
measurments.

Indeed there turns out to be at least one additional planet in the system that
is not transiting as is presented in Sect.~\ref{sect:gj1132bonfils}.

\section{Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher to Join HARPS on the ESO 3.6-metre
  Telescope \citep{bouchy17}}
This paper summarized the current status of the up-coming near-IR spectrograph
NIRPS (\emph{Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher}) including an overview of its design
and primary science goals. As an instrument paper all science team members were
added as co-authors including myself as a Canadian collaborator. I did however
contribute directly to the discussion of the NIRPS science goal of searching
for new RV planetary systems in the southern sky that may be amenable to direct
imaging with ELTs. Those specific contributions were calculations of the
expected NIRPS planet yield. These calculations were based on the simulations
presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:BS} for the
SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search after modifications to the simulated
observing strategy and instrument performance were made as they pertain to
NIRPS.


\section{Quantifying the Evidence for a Planet in Radial Velocity Data
  \citep{nelson18}}
The paper presents the results of a collaborative study that was conceived in
a breakout session during the \emph{Extremely Precise Radial Velocities III}
conference at Penn State. When searching for planets in an RV dataset
$\mathbf{y}$, robustly 
quantifying the detection of a planet requires the Bayesian evidence
$\mathcal{Z}$ of an RV model $M$, that contains that planet, to
be greater than a competing model $M'$ that does not. Explicitly, the evidence
integral is

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{y}|M) = \int_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{y}|\theta,M)
  \cdot \Pi(\theta|M) \text{d} \theta
\end{equation}

\noindent and requires one to integrate the product of the data likelihood
$\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{y}|\theta,M)$ and full model parameter prior
$\Pi(\theta|M)$ over the full model parameter space $\theta$.
The evidence integral is expensive to compute accurately and many computational
methods have been proposed to calculate or approximate $\mathcal{Z}$.

In this study, a number of astronomers from differing RV groups were given
identical synthetic RV
datasets with injected planets that we were agnostic to. The groups were then
tasked with using our favourite methods to calculate or approximate
$\mathcal{Z}$ using those datasets are a consistent set of priors. This paper
was comparative study of those methods.

My contribution was to test two non-Bayesian methods that operate
analogously to the Bayesian evidence ratio (i.e. ratio of two model evidences
$\mathcal{Z}_1$ and $\mathcal{Z}_2$) for the purposes of model comparison. These
methods are leave-one-out cross-validation and time-series cross-validation
and do not calculate $\mathcal{Z}$. Instead they are used to compute the
predictive power of a given model such that if a model containing $N+1$ planets
demonstrates more predictive power on unseen previously unseen RV measurements
(i.e. it is more accurate), then $N+1$ planets are favoured in the dataset
than just $N$ planets.
